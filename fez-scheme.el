;;; Commentary:

;; This package contains my attempt to implement the exercises in
;; Christian Quinnec's textbook "Lisp in Small Pieces.", implemented
;; in the Emacs Lisp runtime.â€¦

;;; Code:

;; Emacs Lisp and Scheme have different definitions for truth and falsity:
;; - Emacs Lisp declares that all values other than NIL are true.
;; - Scheme declares that all values other than #f are true.
;; Since we cannot depend on the defining language and the defined
;; language working the same way, we will have tp explicitly create
;; boolean values we can thus evaluate in a schemelike way.
(defvar fez-boolean-true '\#t)

;; granted in Scheme that the empty list equates to NIL. [LISP pg. 10]

;; We need an empty environment to start with
